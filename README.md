# Social Network

## [Just try it!](https://Tatsiana1111.github.io/social-network)
## The project is under development, some features are unavailable.

### Lightels is a social network for communication, sharing contacts and browsing posts by interests. 
We provide an initialization profile for test, but you can also register in the system yourself.

### You can fill out your profile and look the profiles of any users registered in the system (currently more than 23,000 users are registered). Also, you can subscribe people and always find your friends on the "My Friends" tab.
### One of the important features of the social network is to indicate the status of #OpenToWork on your avatar, which shows that you are currently looking for a job now. Also, you can add your skills, projects links and contacts to profile information.
